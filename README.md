Explaining Test Strategy:

I followed the given requirements step by step, and wrote a test for each functionality
The only problem i stumbled upon was, that the backstage quality does not increase by 3 when the SellIn date is 5 or less,
which made the test fail. I made a Test for the Conjured Items, but functionality is not yet implemented.
